# COOL-CHIC - Fork for "Redefining Visual Quality: The Impact of Loss Functions On INR-Based Image Compression" (ICIP 2024)

This is a fork of [COOL-CHIC](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/Cool-Chic/) for the IEEE ICIP 2024 paper "Redefining Visual Quality: The Impact of Loss Functions On INR-Based Image Compression". 
Each branch contains an adaptation of COOL-CHIC 1 and 2, with novel loss functions implemented and some modifications to the launch scripts.
Please refer to the original repository for the official implementation.
